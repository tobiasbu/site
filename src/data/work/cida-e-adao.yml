  {% note "warning","Important Note","We acknowledge that this game contains elements of fatphobia.
  We regret any harm this may cause and recognize that it could have been developed differently. 
  Although the team no longer exists to address feedback, we appreciate your understanding.
  Despite this issue, the Cida & Adão game was an important project for my self-development
  and career." %}

  **Cida & Adão** was a game designed when I worked as intern at [ObservaSinos](https://www.ihu.unisinos.br/observasinos).
  The game included students from the Nutrition, Game Development and 
  Social Work academic courses.
  The goal of the game was to raise awareness about health and
  nutrition among young people. 
  
  In this exciting adventure, you'll need to
  master the art of appetite control, eating only when necessary and
  avoiding the pitfalls of overindulgence.  You'll face the challenge of steering 
  clear of gluttonous pigs determined to derail your progress. 
  Engage with different puzzles and take up the rewarding task of growing your own food. 
  
  To beat the game you'll need to face the formidable capitalist pig who
  stands in your way and emerge conscious citizen.

  ## Features:

  * Appetite Control: Learn the balance of eating just enough and steering clear of junk food.
  * Avoid the Gluttons: Outsmart the gluttonous pigs that aim to ruin your game.
  * Final battle: Confront and defeat the terrible capitalist pig to complete your quest.

  Invite your friends, embrace the challenge, and embark on this educational and
  entertaining journey with Cida & Adão!
