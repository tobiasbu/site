  [Scintilla](https://github.com/tobiasbu/scintilla) is a small and Open-Source HTML5 Game Engine canvas based. 
  Inspired by [melonJS](http://melonjs.org/), [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) 
  allows you to create fast games from small projects.

  Scintilla was started in 2016 when I was learning HTML5 syntax in JavaScript. The initial version, tobiJS,
  was written in pure ECMAScript 5. After two years, I refactored the entire engine using 
  modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) to improve its architecture and design.

  The engine is designed for the game development community, catering to both beginners and advanced developers. 
  Scintilla provides a comprehensive system for creating prototypes, experimenting with ideas,
  and developing art games, retro games, and more.

  ## Current Features

  - Sprite and spritesheet rendering.
  - Loads tilemaps from Tiled JSON format.
  - Manage complex animations easily.
  - Pooling for game objects.
  - Signals to listen to engine events.
  - Supports multiple asset formats.
  - Simple transition effects.
  - Includes easing functions and object validation.
  - Provides lists, maps, and sets.
  - Handles keyboard and mouse input.
