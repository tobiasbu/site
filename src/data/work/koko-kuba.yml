excerpt: "An game about a fish shoal that through rhythm must challenge the deep and polluted seas of Brazil."

about: |-2
  Dive into an epic underwater adventure where the rhythm of the deep guides your every move! üåä

  Koko-Kuba is a rhythmic game developed by me at university for the "Engine Project" class. 
  I invested a lot of time developing it and I also acquired business partners that contributed with the game somehow.
  With this reason, I decided to move the game development to a commercial approach and I hopefully to release it 
  someday.
  
story: |-2

  In the mystical depths of rivers and oceans, Aba√ßa√≠, a once-noble deep-sea merman, declares war on the Koko-Kubas. 
  He believes that this vibrant shoal of fish is to blame for the ocean's pollution. 
  However, the true culprits lie above the waves ‚Äî humans.

  The Koko-Kubas, led by the wise and ancient fish Kaluan√£, son of Piruju, have long protected the oceans.
  With the beat of tambourines, the shake of rattles, the echo of the Sacred Whistle, 
  and the calming tone of the Vigilant Peace Pipe, they prepare for the ultimate showdown to defend their home.
  
  Kaluan√£ rallies his troops with a powerful declaration:

  _"For the defense of the river, the sea, for our scales and for the future fry. 
  fish of all colors, sizes, and weights, unite! For fish that are united will never float."_
