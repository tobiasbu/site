excerpt: "An game about a fish shoal that through rhythm must challenge the deep and polluted seas of Brazil."

about: |-2
  Dive into an underwater adventure where the rhythm of the seas guides your every move! üåä

  Koko-Kuba is a rhythmic game developed by me at university for the "Engine Project" class. 
  I invested a lot of time developing it and I also acquired business partners that contributed with the game somehow.
  With this reason, I decided to move the game development to a commercial approach and I hopefully to release it 
  someday.
  
story: |-2

  Aba√ßa√≠, the deep-sea merman chief, declares war on the Koko-Kubas. 
  He believes this vibrant school of fish is to blame for the ocean's pollution. 
  However, the true culprits lie above the waves...

  The Koko-Kubas, led by the wise and ancient fish Kaluan√£, son of Piruju, have long protected the oceans.
  With the beat of tambourines, the shake of rattles, the echo of the Sacred Whistle,
  and the calming the Vigilant Peace Pipe, they prepare for the ultimate showdown to defend their home.
  
  Kaluan√£ rallies his comrades with a powerful declaration:

  _"For the defense of the river, the sea, for our scales and for the future fry.
  Fish of all colors, sizes, and weights, unite!
  Because fish that are united will never float."_
