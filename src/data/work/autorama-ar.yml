  This game was developed for the Virtual Reality class and offers a interactive experience.
  To play, simply draw a race course on a piece of paper. Then, use a webcam to
  scan your drawing, and you'll be able to race on the course you've created!

  ## Features:
  - **Course Scanner**: Utilize a webcam to scan your course race draw and import it to the game.
  - **Interactive Gameplay**: Play on the race course you designed!

  The project was built using C++, OpenCV, the SFML-Audio module, Glut, and OpenGL, 
  demonstrating a blend of various technologies for an immersive and engaging virtual reality experience.
