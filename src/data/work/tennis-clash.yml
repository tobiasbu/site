  [Tennis Clash](https://wildlifestudios.com/games/tennis-clash) is an mobile game developed 
  by [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/). In this project, I played a crucial role 
  in the successful launch of Tennis Clash in China by adapting the metagame and other parts
  of the game to meet Chinese publishing requirements.

  As a Fullstack Engineer, I was deeply involved in:

  - Developing user interfaces: Ensuring that the game was visually engaging and user-friendly.
  - Integrating the business partner SDK: Seamlessly integrating the SDK from native code and exposing it in Unity.
  - User Recovery Flow: Implementing the business partner login provider to recover user data from China.
  - Payment System: Ensuring secure and efficient in-game transactions.
  - Analytics: Improve UA flows for specific audiences.
