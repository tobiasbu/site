  [Tennis Clash](https://wildlifestudios.com/games/tennis-clash) is an mobile game developed 
  by [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/). In this project, I played a crucial role 
  in the successful launch of Tennis Clash in China by adapting the metagame and other parts
  of the game to meet Chinese publishing requirements.

  As a Fullstack Engineer, I was deeply involved in:

  - Ensuring that the metagame was visually engaging and user-friendly.
  - Business partner SDK integration from native code and exposing it in Unity.
  - Login provider implementation to recover user data from China.
  - Payment System by ensuring secure and efficient in-game transactions.
