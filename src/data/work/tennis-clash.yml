  [Tennis Clash](https://wildlifestudios.com/games/tennis-clash) is an mobile game developed 
  by [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/). In this project, I played a crucial role 
  in the successful launch of Tennis Clash in China by adapting the metagame and other parts
   of the game to meet Chinese publishing requirements.

  As a Fullstack Engineer, I was deeply involved in:

  - Developing user interfaces: Ensuring that the game was visually engaging and user-friendly.
  - Implementing game changes: Making necessary adjustments to enhance the gameplay experience.
  - Integrating the business partner SDK: Seamlessly integrating the SDK from native code and exposing it in Unity.

  This integration demanded significant changes to the game backend, including:

    - User Recovery Flow: Implementing a robust system to recover user data.
    - Payment System: Ensuring secure and efficient in-game transactions.
    - Analytics: to improve UA flows.
