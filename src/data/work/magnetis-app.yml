  As a senior software engineer, I focused on product maintenance, 
  assisting mobile developers with issue resolution, improving CI/CD pipelines, 
  addressing technical debts, writing internal documentation, and engaging in general mobile programming. 
  Additionally, I developed new features for the company's application. I worked at Magnetis Investimentos 
  for 1 year and 7 months.

  **Update**: magnetis was sold to BTG Pactual ([news link](https://startups.com.br/negocios/ma/btg-pactual-compra-magnetis-para-reforcar-portfolio-digital/)). 
  Unfortunately the app was removed from the stores.
