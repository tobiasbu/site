  [Super Marduino](https://github.com/tobiasbu/marduino) is a platform game developed using the Arduino Uno, 
  featuring components such as the Nokia 5110 display and three buttons.
  This simple game uses the classic Super Mario Land graphics for GameBoy, 
  bringing a gaming experience to a DIY electronics project.

  I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my friend, 
  Reginaldo da Silva, who taught me a bit about electronics and generously lent me his Arduino Uno.
