excerpt: "Fair trade? Small game about the new and old bugreiros."

about: |-2

  In this game, the issue of indigenous land demarcation being appropriated by neo-bugreiros is explored. 
  
  A **Bugreiro** was an individual hired by the Brazil imperial governments 
  of the provinces of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul,  Santa Catarina, and São Paulo,
  with the function of exterminating indigenous people. 
  The term originates from the word _bugre_, which was the pejorative term used by
  the non-indigenous population to refer to the indigenous people of southern Brazil.

  With this analogy in mind, the Neo-Bugreiro, the new bugreiros of contemporary times, were conceived.
  They are found in society as the rural elite, who steal indigenous lands in the worst way,
  martyring and massacring them. The game was inspired by the video "A Troca" by the 
  Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL5b_jP1VjM).

  This game was created as a submission for [Antifa Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/antifa-game-jam),
  which is an antifascist game jam. The game was built and released in April 2018, and is available
  on the itch.io platform, where it can be played online [here](https://tobiasbu.itch.io/neo-bugreiro). 
  The game was created using the Scintilla Game Engine, and the art was done in pixel-art with the NES console palette.
  The music was composed by Nils Fiske.
