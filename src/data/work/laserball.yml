  Laserball is an electrifying digital game crafted for friends by the innovative minds at [Ideia à Vista](http://ideiaavista.com.br/) company. 
  
  Imagine a futuristic indoor arena sport where two goalkeepers and two players — shaped like
  sleek discs — battle it out with a smaller disc acting as the "ball". The mission? 
  Score the most goals before time runs out. But there's a twist: monsters! 
  Yes, one of three different monsters randomly appears to ramp up the challenge and add a whole lot of fun.

  ### Gameplay highlights

  * A thrilling mix of air hockey and snooker, with a monstrous twist!
  * Three different monsters randomly appear to make every match unpredictable and exhilarating.
  * Bet with your friend: play a game in bet mode and whoever wins gets a beer!

  The Laserball table blends the nostalgia of arcade games with cutting-edge technology.
  It's a key part of [Game Pub](https://gamepub.ideiaavista.com/), Ideia à Vista's strategic business initiative—a franchise of gamified pubs
  that redefine leisure and dining with exclusive digital gaming tables.

  As the game programmer on this project, I was responsible for bringing these features to life:
  * Crafting the enemies' AI to keep players on their toes.
  * Implementing power-up abilities for that extra competitive edge.
  * Designing intuitive menus and eye-catching splash screens to enhance the gaming experience.

  So, gather your friends, grab some beers, and dive into the ultimate Laserball showdown. 
  Fun and excitement guaranteed!
