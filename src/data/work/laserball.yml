  Laserball is an electrifying digital game crafted for friends by [Ideia à Vista](http://ideiaavista.com.br/) company. 
  
  Imagine a futuristic, dystopian indoor arena sport where two 'disc' drivers battle it out against each other.
  As the player, you need to score the most goals before time runs out. 
  But there's a twist: monsters! 
  Yes, one of three different monsters randomly appears to increase the challenge!

  The Laserball table blends the nostalgia of arcade games with cutting-edge technology.
  It's a key part of [Game Pub](https://gamepub.ideiaavista.com/), Ideia à Vista's strategic
  business initiative franchise of gamified pubs that redefine leisure and dining with exclusive digital gaming tables.
  
  ## Gameplay highlights

  ## My role

  * Implementing power-up abilities for extra competitive edge.
  * Designing intuitive menus and splash screens to enhance the gaming experience.
