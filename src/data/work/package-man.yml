  Package-Man is an arcade game developed using Unity. 
  The game is inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man and the primary 
  goal is to collect dots through a maze, collect all the energizers,
  and avoid the mail carriers.

  This project aimed to reimplement the main mechanics of Pac-Man based in the 
  [The Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info/) written by Jamey Pittman.

  ## Features:

  - Navigate through a maze, collect 'packages dots' and avoid being caught by the mail carriers.
  - Mail carrier AI is totally based in the original Pac-Man ghosts personalities.
  - 3 stages available
  - Art created from scratch and sound effects from the original game.
  - Compete with others to achieve the highest score and track your progress over time.

  ## Fun-fact

  This game was initially an application for the Gameplay Programmer role at a game studio.
  The only condition from my side was remote or hybrid work since the
  game studio's location was far from my home. 
  Some friends were also applicants for the same position. No one was hired.
