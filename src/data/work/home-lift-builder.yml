  As a freelancer, I developed the Home Lift Builder with ThreeJS for thyssenkrupp, 
  creating a WebGL simulation that runs in-browser across all platforms. 
  This project involved using TypeScript, three.js, and other tools. 
  Additionally, I provided JavaScript consulting for the front-end team.

  Note: The lift builder project was updated which I was not involved.
  You can access it [here](https://homelift-configurator.tkelevator.com/).
  The first version was removed.
