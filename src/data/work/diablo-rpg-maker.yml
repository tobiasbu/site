  Diablo is a dark fantasy role-playing game developed by _Blizzard Entertainment_. 
  This project was a fan-game created in [RPG Maker 2000](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383730/RPG_Maker_2000/)
  with the integration of the Destiny Patch 2.0 developed by Bananen-Joe.
  Unfortunately, the game production was cancelled.

  From this project, I learned a lot about logic, programming and pixel art. 
  It was also where I mastered the RPG Maker 2000 engine, despite its significant limitations. 
  The main issue that halted my progress was the complexity of creating the inventory system,
  which I had to redo many times. Despite that, the project received a lot of positive feedback
  from the RPG Maker communities.
  
  I still feel compelled to work in a similar project. However, I would approach it with
  my own ideas this time: a new entirely game, not limited to just being a fan game 
  but rather an original creation of my own.

  The following text is not canon to the original game but is my own creation
  inspired by the texts provided by Blizzard:

  ### The Rise of the Three

  Before the rise of the Western empires, the world of men was terrorized bythe malevolent entities
  known as **The Three Evils**. These eternal beings, banished from hell, roamed the earth, 
  feeding on human desires and sowing chaos and conflict. They pitted father against son and 
  plunged great nations into brutal, senseless wars. Their insatiable hunger for suffering and 
  domination led them to ravage the lands of the Far East for countless centuries.

  But hope was not lost. The enigmatic **archangel Tyrael** secretly gathered a group of mortal
  wizards to combat this evil. This secret order, known as the **Horadrim**, was comprised of 
  wizards from various clans across the East. Despite their diverse origins, 
  hey shared a common purpose—to hunt down The Three Evils and end their reign of terror.

  Under the guidance of Tyrael, the Horadrim embarked on a perilous journey, 
  drawing strength from their diverse allies and unique skills. While the exact number and 
  identities of these brave wizards remain shrouded in mystery, it was their collective efforts
  — and the players dedication — that ultimately led to the success of their quest.
